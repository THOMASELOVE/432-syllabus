["course-description.html", "Section 1 Course Description 1.1 Prerequisites 1.2 Everything is on the Web", " Section 1 Course Description PQHS 432 (cross-listed as, for example, CRSP 432 and MPHP 432, and formerly known as EPBI 432) is the second half of a two-semester sequence (with PQHS 431) focused on modern data analysis and advanced statistical modeling, with a practical bent (as little theory as possible), emphasizing the key role of thinking hard, and well, about design and analysis in research. The title listed by the registrar is a little dated - I prefer Data Science for Biological, Medical or Health Research. This is a good course for people who want to learn how to use the R language to get information from data, and who want to learn about making comparisons and building models to help make meaningful progress in research, focusing on questions from biology, medicine and public health. We spend time managing and visualizing data, building models and making predictions, and other things thought of as “data science” - in essence, this highly applied course focuses on modern, more than classical, tools for learning from data. The course is taught using the R statistical software and RStudio environments, with the material discussed in 431 assumed in 432. Students learned a lot of R in the 431 course, and that material remains available at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431. We’ll continue to use R Studio and R Markdown as tools to help make R work better, and perform our research in replicable ways. 1.1 Prerequisites Taking 432 without 431 is not recommended. The pace can be brisk at times, but all CWRU students who feel up to it are welcome, in any field of study. 1.2 Everything is on the Web https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2018 is the place to go for everything related to this course. Please visit any time you need something. I update the web site frequently.
